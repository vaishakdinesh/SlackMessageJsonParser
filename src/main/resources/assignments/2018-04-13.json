I wish there was time, but still you do have the opportunity to express your conclusions and experiences in your “report”. Many teams do create a presentation using powerpoint, keynote, prezi, whatever but it’s not required. Excellent reports can get bonus points, though (see Emily Strong’s report, for example).",

Basically, the question was “can I replace _log4j_ with `System.out.println`?” My answer: well, I suppose so, but _log4j_ is much more elegant--and doesn’t get in the way of your program. Still, it’s more important to get the GA working and then, perhaps later, change to use _log4j_.",
