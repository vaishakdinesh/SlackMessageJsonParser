The other source of possible confusion is that you might think that (lambda) function _f_ has to be the sort method itself. Not at all. You need to write a lambda which takes an _Integer_ (_T_) and sorts that number of elements from a (static) array. After all, you don't want to be instantiating and populating the array for every repetition. I'm sorry I didn't make that clearer.",
