The problem was that we were testing a method (_move_) that should really have been private (because it isn’t part of the API) but was declared public just so that I could run unit tests on it. I thought there was a way to do it with JUnit (but I think I’m mixing it up with Scala test). So, I have created my own private method tester. All of these updates are in the repo now. You can find the private method tester (and its test class) in the _util_ package of the _test_ sources. I hope you will find it interesting (it has to use reflection).",

There are two independent check boxes: one to make it available and one to delay availability. Both have to be checked! Very poor design: why would you ever want to set a date for availability if you never wanted it to be available (which is what I did)??",
