        "text": "There have been some questions about assignment 5 particularly regarding whether students have to create a hash table. The answer is no. All you have to do is to maintain an int array of size M and every time a random object (the “key”) is hashed to a value between 0 and M-1, you increment the indexed array value. When the C1 and B0 events occur, make a note of how many hashes were required to get there.",
