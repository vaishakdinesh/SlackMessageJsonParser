This is especially a concern on Tuesdays because I expect that you will do the quizzes without consulting books, internet, friends, etc. If you are not in class, it is hard to be sure of this. Therefore there will be bonus question for those of you who are physically present. Furthermore, if I even see a phone, or if there is any talking or sharing of information during the quiz, you will be disqualified from the quiz. I hope that is 100% clear.",
