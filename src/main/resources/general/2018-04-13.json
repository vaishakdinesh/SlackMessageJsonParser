Never jump into a coding challenge without giving it at least a minute’s thought. If it’s a live challenge then tell them right away that you’re going to think the problem through for a bit...\n2) Stay with logic. Cold logic. Is the approach you are taking going to reduce the search space for the correct solution? Or is it going in a roundabout way and not getting you anywhere?\n3) Dead ends (aka rat holes). If you go down a dead-end, stop and think to yourself why you went down that dead end. What bad assumption did you make that led you to going in the wrong direction. Again, give yourself time for thought. Extricate yourself from the dead end and then try to cast about for the right direction to go in (see item 2). Whatever you do, once you suspect that you’re at a dead end, don’t keep shoveling dirt and just deepening the hole you’re in. Especially if it’s a live challenge. Tell them you think you went down a rat hole and you’re going to back up.\n4) Write code that is simple, obvious and elegant (SOE). It’s extremely unlikely that the code they want you to write requires any special cases (corner cases) or anything like that. The more elegant your code a) the more likely it will work; b) the more likely that if it doesn’t work, you’ll be able to see the problem; and c) the more the interviewer will be able to see what you’re doing (and hopefully be impressed). Elegant coders are the kind of coders they are looking for!\nThat’s it. Oh, and rule 5?  DON’T PANIC!  <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(fictional)>",
