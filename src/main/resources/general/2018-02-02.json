I saw the `i++` as `j++` and I knew that wasn’t right. BUT, I was not happy with the amount of chatter that followed. What you may not realize is that these auditoriums focus the sound from the seats down near where I stand. It is very distracting, not to mention that I have to shout to overcome it. Please let’s behave a little more considerately next time. Go Pats!",
